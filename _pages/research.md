<p>
I am passionate about harnessing remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and statistical analysis to address critical challenges in agriculture, food security, and environmental sustainability. My research centers on the synergy between these fields, with a particular focus on the biosphere.

<h3>AI Agents for Environmental Intelligence</h3>
<p>
A significant focus of my current work and future research is the development and deployment of autonomous AI agents for advanced geospatial and environmental intelligence. These agents are engineered to operate independently, continuously ingesting and analyzing vast streams of satellite and sensor data. Their core capabilities include real-time anomaly detection, predictive modeling, and the generation of actionable insights for decision support, all without direct human oversight. By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as large language models (LLMs) for nuanced interpretation, advanced computer vision for image analysis, and multi-agent systems for collaborative problem-solving, these AI agents can decipher complex environmental patterns, produce comprehensive analytical reports, and even initiate or recommend timely interventions.

<h3>Forecasting & Decision Support</h3>
<p>
My work involves developing innovative methods for forecasting crop yield and price variations using satellite-derived data. By leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms—including deep learning and the aforementioned autonomous AI agents—I aim to deliver early, accurate, and actionable predictions. The integration of AI agents enables continuous monitoring, rapid anomaly detection, and automated decision support, significantly enhancing the timeliness and reliability of insights for stakeholders. This research has the potential to inform strategic planning, improve food security, and optimize resource allocation in agricultural systems.

<h3>Applied AI at Promethee Earth Intelligence</h3>
<p>
At Promethee Earth Intelligence, I lead the development of advanced AI models for geospatial intelligence. My work includes designing algorithms for maritime vessel detection and identification from satellite imagery, developing tools for automated analysis of large-scale documents, and creating AI-driven models to estimate environmental variables by integrating satellite data with physical modeling. These projects combine computer vision, natural language processing, and geospatial analytics to deliver actionable intelligence for environmental monitoring and security applications.

<h3>Beyond Agriculture</h3>
<p>
Beyond agriculture, I am actively exploring the application of remote sensing and AI in other domains, such as land-cover classification, vegetation health monitoring, environmental anomaly detection, and sustainable natural resource management. I am particularly interested in the deployment of autonomous AI agents that can analyze large-scale geospatial data, interpret complex environmental patterns, and support real-time decision-making across diverse ecosystems, contributing to a more resilient and sustainable planet.
