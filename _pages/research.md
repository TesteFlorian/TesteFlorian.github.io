I am passionate about leveraging remote sensing, machine learning, and statistical analysis to address critical challenges in agriculture, food security, and environmental sustainability. My research focuses on the synergy of these fields applied to the biosphere.

I am developing innovative methods for forecasting crop yield and price variations using satellite-derived data. By utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, including deep learning approaches, I aim to provide early, accurate, and actionable predictions. This research has the potential to inform strategic planning, improve food security, and optimize resource allocation in agricultural systems.

Beyond agriculture, I am actively exploring and am interested in applying remote sensing and machine learning in other domains, such as land-cover classification, vegetation health monitoring and characterization, and sustainable natural resource management.
