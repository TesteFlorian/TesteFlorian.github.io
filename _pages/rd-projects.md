I develop applied AI systems that transform Earth Observation (EO) data into actionable intelligence. My research integrates geospatial machine learning, computer vision, and probabilistic modeling to address critical challenges in food security, maritime security, and environmental resilience.

## Geospatial Intelligence & Multi-Sensor Fusion

- **Foundation Models:** Adapting EO-specific Vision Transformers (ViTs), Masked Autoencoders (MAEs), and spatiotemporal architectures for vessel detection, flood mapping, and crop monitoring.
- **Multi-sensor fusion:** Integrate SAR, optical, LiDAR, and AIS signals using STAC-native pipelines, delivering near–real time situational awareness.

## Computer Vision for Remote Sensing

- **Object Detection & Segmentation:** Implementing state-of-the-art architectures for high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery analysis.
- **Domain Adaptation:** Fine-tuning vision transformers on domain-specific EO datasets to enhance land-cover classification and object identification.
- **Automated Change Detection:** Building end-to-end pipelines for anomaly identification and large-scale scene understanding.

## Agricultural Intelligence & Food Security

- **Yield & Price Forecasting:** Processing multi-terabyte satellite streams to generate early-season yield and price predictions for global commodities.
- **Self-Supervised Learning:** Leveraging VAEs and contrastive learning to extract phenological signals months ahead of harvest.
- **Open Methodologies:** Publishing reproducible frameworks that enable NGOs and governments to implement data-driven interventions with extended lead times.

## Environmental Monitoring & Climate Resilience

- **Forestry & Carbon Accounting:** Fusing LiDAR and Sentinel imagery to estimate forest structural attributes for climate reporting and sustainable management.
- **Disaster Response:** Detecting floods, vegetation stress, and land-use changes using multimodal data and domain-adapted neural architectures.
- **Research-to-Production:** Collaborating with R&D labs to transition research prototypes into scalable production services.

<!-- ## Current Research & Experiments

- **Scaling EO Foundation Models:** Exploring adaptive fine-tuning techniques for maritime anomaly detection.
- **Probabilistic Deep Learning:** Developing VAEs and Normalizing Flows to improve uncertainty estimation in remote sensing tasks.
- **Robust Forecasting:** Benchmarking probabilistic approaches for commodity market forecasting under significant data drift. -->
