I design applied AI systems that turn earth-observation data into operational intelligence. My works combines geospatial machine learning, agentic analytics, and probabilistic modelling to support decision-makers facing climate, food security, and maritime challenges.

## Geospatial Intelligence Systems

- **Foundation backbones:** Adapt EO-specific Vision Transformers, masked autoencoders, and spatiotemporal transformers for vessel, flood, and crop monitoring.
- **Multi-sensor fusion:** Integrate SAR, optical, LiDAR, and AIS signals using STAC-native pipelines, delivering near–real time situational awareness.
- **Uncertainty-aware forecasts:** Pair quantile and conformal methods with causal inference to provide calibrated predictions and clear risk bounds.

## Agentic Analytics for Analysts

- Build retrieval-augmented LLM agents that orchestrate Model Context Protocol tools across text, imagery, and geospatial APIs.
- Equip analysts with structured outputs, traceable citations, and automated GEOINT reporting workflows.
- Evaluate agent performance with task harnesses that measure accuracy, latency, and trust metrics.

## Food Security Forecasting

- Develop pipelines that convert multi-terabyte satellite streams into early-season yield and price forecasts for global commodities.
- Explore self-supervised feature extraction (AEs, VAEs, contrastive learning) to capture phenological signals months before harvest.
- Publish open methodologies enabling governments and NGOs to plan interventions with weeks of additional lead time.

## Environmental Monitoring & Forestry

- Fuse LiDAR and Sentinel imagery to estimate forest structural attributes for climate reporting and sustainable management.
- Detect floods, vegetation stress, and land-use change with multimodal data and domain-adapted neural architectures.
- Collaborate with R&D labs and industry partners to translate prototypes into production services.

## Current Experiments

- Scaling EO foundation models with adaptive fine-tuning for maritime anomaly detection.
- Extending agentic pipelines with continuous learning loops and human-in-the-loop validation.
- Benchmarking probabilistic deep learning approaches for commodity market forecasting under data drift.
