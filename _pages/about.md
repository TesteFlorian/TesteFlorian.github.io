I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University Paris-Saclay, nearing the completion of my doctoral research. My focus is on the innovative integration of data science, machine learning, and environmental sciences. I specialize in leveraging advanced geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques to monitor and characterize the biosphere.

My current research, funded by Atos, aims to develop a groundbreaking framework for forecasting agricultural commodity prices and yields directly from satellite data using machine learning approaches. By harnessing the power of machine learning, I aim to exploit the vast and underutilized information provided by satellite data.

Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and tools, including Python, R, Julia, Bash, and Git, along with relevant machine learning libraries in these languages. This proficiency has been instrumental in translating theoretical concepts into practical solutions, as evidenced by my experience as a Consultant Data Scientist at Atos and a Deep Learning Scientist Intern at INRAE.

I actively contribute to the scientific community through publications in reputable journals and presentations at conferences and workshops. My passion for interdisciplinary collaboration and commitment to excellence drive me to continuously seek new opportunities to apply my expertise and make meaningful contributions to academia and industry.
