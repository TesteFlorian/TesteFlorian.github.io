I am a Senior Geospatial Machine Learning Scientist at Promethee Earth Intelligence, holding a Ph.D. in Machine Learning Applied to Remote Sensing from Paris-Saclay University. My expertise centers on the innovative integration of data science, machine learning, and environmental sciences, with a strong focus on advanced geospatial analysis and remote sensing.


## Current Work


At Promethee Earth Intelligence, I lead the development of AI models for maritime vessel detection and identification from satellite imagery, design algorithms for detecting suspicious activities using satellite data, and build AI-based tools for automated analysis of large-scale documents to support geospatial intelligence. I also create AI-driven models to estimate environmental variables by integrating satellite data with physical modeling.


## Research Background

My doctoral research, completed in February 2025, resulted in a novel framework that uses machine learning to predict global agricultural commodity prices and yields directly from satellite data. This approach eliminates the need for unreliable regional production and demand estimates, contributing to enhanced global food security through more accurate and timely forecasts months before harvest. This work has led to several peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences.


## Technical Expertise

Through these projects, I have developed strong skills in a range of programming languages and tools, including:
- **Languages:** Python, R, Julia, Bash
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Rioxarray, GDAL
- **Development Tools:** Git, Docker
- **NLP & Computer Vision:** Transformers, computer vision libraries

My passion for interdisciplinary collaboration and commitment to excellence drive me to continuously seek new opportunities to apply my expertise and make meaningful contributions to both academia and industry.
