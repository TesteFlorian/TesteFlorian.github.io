I’m a third-year PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Paris-Saclay University. My work focuses on the innovative integration of data science, machine learning, and environmental sciences. I specialise in using advanced geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques to monitor and characterise the biosphere.
My current research, funded by Atos, aims to develop a groundbreaking framework to forecast agricultural commodity prices and crop yields directly from satellite data using machine learning approaches. By harnessing the power of machine learning, I aim to exploit the vast and underutilised information provided by satellite data. I published the results of this work in several articles in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences and workshops.
These projects led me to develop strong skills in various programming languages and tools. My main expertise focuses on Python, R, and Julia, alongside relevant machine learning libraries in these languages. I’m also familiar with Bash and Git.
Nearing completing my doctoral project, I’m looking for the next step of my professional journey!
My passion for interdisciplinary collaboration and commitment to excellence drives me to continuously seek new opportunities to apply my expertise and make meaningful contributions to academia and industry.
