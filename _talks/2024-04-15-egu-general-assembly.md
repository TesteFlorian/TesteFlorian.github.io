Shared results from my Ph.D. research on forecasting crop yield and price variations using satellite-derived Gross Primary Production (GPP) and deep learning.

- Demonstrated how self-supervised embeddings capture pre-harvest phenology signals months in advance.
- Compared probabilistic ML against classical time-series baselines to highlight where satellite-informed models dominate.
- Discussed implications for global food security monitoring and commodity risk management.
