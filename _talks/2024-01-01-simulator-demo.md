  A comparative walkthrough of R frameworks for designing, running, and documenting statistical simulations, presented to an expert panel.
---

Walked a panel of scientists, data scientists, and statisticians through the comparative study that underpins our simulation practice. Discussion points included:

- Criteria for choosing between simpr, simulator, SimEngine, and simChef depending on auditability and scale requirements.
- Lessons learned from implementing power-curve studies across multiple frameworks.
- Opportunities to standardise evaluation harnesses and provenance tracking for future methodological experiments.

The simulator walkthrough, including reproducible Quarto source, is available on the [dedicated page]({{ '/simulator/' | relative_url }}).
