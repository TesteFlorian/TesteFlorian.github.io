Presented the modelling stack underpinning my crop forecasting research, emphasising:

- Construction of multi-terabyte satellite pipelines and feature extraction with autoencoders and variational autoencoders.
- Calibration strategies (quantile regression, conformal prediction) to provide decision-grade confidence intervals.
- Lessons learned deploying the approach across the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa.
