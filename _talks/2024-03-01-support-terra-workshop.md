  Tutorial-led session introducing Terra, tidyterra, ggplot2, and dplyr for manipulating SpatVector and SpatRaster data.
---

Highlights from the session:

- Compared `SpatVector` and `SpatRaster` representations and how Terra stores geometry and attributes.
- Demonstrated imports, re-projections, reclassification, and exports of raster layers.
- Showcased tidyterra + ggplot2 for rapid map creation with interactive code-folding aids.
- Discussed workflow tips for integrating Terra into reproducible Quarto notebooks.
