This preprint analyses how satellite-derived Gross Primary Production (GPP) datasets can power early warning systems for commodity markets. We study three contrasting regions (US, Malawi, South Africa) and compare:

- Dimensionality reduction via empirical orthogonal functions, autoencoders, and β-variational autoencoders.
- Classification models based on ElasticNet and Random Forest.
- Evaluation protocols with single versus double-nested cross-validation to quantify generalisation.

Results show that autoencoder-derived features combined with ElasticNet deliver the best predictive performance, while double-nested cross-validation avoids optimistic bias. The methodology lays the groundwork for robust market surveillance tools driven purely by open satellite products.
