This preprint details an end-to-end pipeline that converts satellite-derived Gross Primary Production (GPP) into quantitative soybean and corn forecasts throughout the growing season. We combine self-supervised embeddings (autoencoders, β-VAEs) with ElasticNet and probabilistic regression to produce calibrated trajectories for both yield and price.

Highlights:

- Achieves R² up to 0.90 for corn yield and 0.75 for soybean yield several months ahead of harvest.
- Outperforms ETS and SARIMA baselines for early- and mid-season price forecasts, while revealing where classical time-series regain dominance late in season.
- Provides model governance guidance by mapping which algorithm families excel at each crop stage.

The system offers a practical toolkit for traders, cooperatives, and policymakers who need high-confidence, high-frequency crop intelligence.
