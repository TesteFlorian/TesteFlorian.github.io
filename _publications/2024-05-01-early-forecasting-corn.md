We introduce a forecasting framework that uses multi-source satellite vegetation products to anticipate corn yield and price deviations. The study combines:

- Temporal aggregation strategies for vegetation indices capturing peak-season dynamics.
- Probabilistic models (ElasticNet, quantile regression) with rigorous calibration checks.
- Cross-market validation across the United States and emerging economies.

By providing accurate early-season signals, the approach helps agribusinesses and policy-makers manage risk in volatile commodity environments.
