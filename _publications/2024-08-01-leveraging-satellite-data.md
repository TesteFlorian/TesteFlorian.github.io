We benchmarked satellite-derived Gross Primary Production (GPP) features and modern neural architectures to predict directional changes in corn yield and prices months ahead of harvest. The study compares empirical orthogonal functions, autoencoders, and variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, then evaluates ElasticNet, Random Forest, and neural classifiers across the US, Malawi, and South Africa.

Key findings include:

- Self-supervised latent features (AE, β-VAE) provide the highest predictive skill, boosting Brier Skill Scores above 0.75 in Malawi.
- Neural architectures outperform classical baselines when paired with satellite-derived latent representations.
- Model performance improves with early-season observations, offering decision-makers more actionable lead time.

The work demonstrates an accessible pathway to deploy high-performing, satellite-enabled forecasting tools in regions with limited agronomic reporting infrastructure.
