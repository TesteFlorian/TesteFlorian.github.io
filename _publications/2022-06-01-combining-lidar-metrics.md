This collaboration benchmarks neural architectures that ingest fused LiDAR and Sentinel-2 inputs to estimate basal area and wood volume in complex Mediterranean forests. Key contributions:

- Curated a high-resolution dataset combining airborne LiDAR metrics with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery.
- Developed neural regressors that outperform traditional inventory approaches across diverse canopy structures.
- Delivered operational insights for forest managers tracking biomass and carbon inventories.
